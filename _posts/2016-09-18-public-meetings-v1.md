This post lays out how to watch or participate in Flux's public meetings. Broadcasts will be via YouTube, and chat will be via Slack.
If you're invited to speak you'll need to ensure you can join a Google Hangout on demand.

If you're just looking to watch you'll find the livestream over on our YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxParty](https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxParty).

If you're looking to participate you'll need the following things open:

* A video of the livestream, available on our [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxParty)
* The Slack channels #livestream-chat, #livestream-motion, and #livestream-prep. (see https://voteflux.org/slack for details on our slack channel)

Additionally if you're invited to speak you'll need to be able to join a hangout on demand; you won't have time to download and install the plugin, so do this first and test it. 
See [this Google support page](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/2944865?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

# How Meetings Progress

Meetings will follow an agenda, and usually be chaired by the Leader (currently Nathan Spataro).
Minutes/action items/etc will be collated on the fly, probably in a slack channel for convenience.

Members wanting to participate will need to use the #livestream-motion channel on slack, and will need a well prepared message to post.
That can be drafted in the #livestream-chat channel, or wherever. The point is that #livestream-motion is a high-quality, low-volume channel for serious well formed motions. 
If there's external documentation it should be linked, and any sizable body of text has to be provided in advance so everyone has a chance to prepare.
Such text can be posted in #livestream-prep, and anything posted at least 24hrs before a meeting can be cited in the meeting.

When a motion is made in #livestream-motion it will need to have a number of members 'thumbs up' it before it'll be discussed in the meeting.
To begin with this number will be 3 'thumbs up', including the original poster.
(The little '+' icon that appears when you hover over a msg allows you to do this).
When this threshold is reached participants of the meeting will discuss it, possibly inviting OP in if that makes sense.

# Who Participates

The default participants will be the Leader, Deputy Leader, Leadership, and official staff roles such as Secretary and Registered Officer.

Other members may be invited in as necessary, but the emphasis will be on a succinct meeting, and discussion is expected to occur outside the meeting proper, in advance.
