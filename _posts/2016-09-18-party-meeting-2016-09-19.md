A proper agenda will be posted here on Monday.

## Pseudo-agenda

Most of the meeting will be regarding new party roles, and asking people to come forward to volunteer and help with various roles.

Particularly, some of the roles we need in the near future are:

* Social Media (man the FB page and Twitter account)
* Graphic Designers (ads, party material, etc)
* Community managers (moderating meetings, for example)
* Not-For-Profit foundation board (this hasn't been created yet, so that's the first job)
* Programmers (particularly for the membership backend/frontend; Python/AngularJS focused)
* Web admin (Taking care of the [website](https://github.com/voteflux/vote-flux-v2), forum, etc; possibly creating & maintaining a wiki...)
* Leadership positions
* Or any other way you can think of to help!

Additionally Nathan and I (Max) will talk a bit about our vision for the near future and the immediate things we need to tackle to get Flux moving.
