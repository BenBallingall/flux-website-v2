  <h2>Current Fundraiser</h2>

  <p>
    We're looking to back <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1713701812/rise-up-the-game-of-people-and-power">this kickstarter campaign</a> at the $2,500 or $5,000 level.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's a new "cooperative board game about building people power and taking on oppressive systems to create change".
  </p>

  <p>
    To help facilitate this, we're happy to announce a <strong>$2 match for every $1 donated</strong> during the month of October, up to $2,300 of donations (for a total of $6,900 for Flux). That means that if you donate $100 Flux will receive $300! There's never been a better time to donate :)
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll log all donations over on the <a href="https://flux.wiki/index.php/Finance/Australia">finance</a> page on our wiki. (All donations are anonymous by default, though please let us know if you'd like attribution)
  </p>

    <h2>Donations</h2>

    <strong>Please note:</strong> If you donate more than $13,000 total in one year we are <strong>required by law</strong> to disclose your name and address to the AEC. We will not be able to accept such donations if we don't have those details. Please email us if you'd like to make a large donation.

    <p>
      NB: The first $1500 of the donation are tax deductable.
    </p>

    <p>
    All donations need to come with a name and address (unfortunately) due to reporting laws. Basically we need to ensure any single person doesn't donate more than $13,000 per year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please let us know via email if you would like public attribution on our <a href="https://flux.wiki/index.php/Finance/Australia">Finances</a> page.

    Flux currently accepts donations via three methods:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Paypal: go to <a href="https://paypal.me/voteflux">https://paypal.me/voteflux</a> to donate quickly and easily. Good for small amounts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bank Transfer: our bank details are:<br>
        Name: Max Kaye <br>
        BSB: 06 2948 <br>
        Acct: 1382 4716 <br>
        Please email us after making a bank transfer with your name and address.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bitcoin: our current donation address is 1EDGSgTW5iGHGesyYACSXYUNbwB6BPEDan<br>
        Please keep in mind the above restrictions around disclosure limits still apply, and you'll still need to email us your name and address. Unless we're holding a fundraiser for something specific we'll hold Bitcoin <em>as BTC</em> until we need to spend it, and will spend AUD before BTC.
