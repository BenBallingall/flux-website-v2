Thank you for becoming a member of Flux!
Hey << Test First Name >>,

Thanks for becoming a member of Flux and supporting a better democracy. We're really excited to have you on board!

Flux, at it's core, is about creating the best version of democracy the world has ever seen. To us, that means it must include everyone. So we'd like to take this opportunity to ask if you can tell as many people about Flux as you can. The Global Flux movement is growing rapidly and we currently have over 5,000 members, like you, registered world wide.

If you would like to get involved you can join the discussion on our community forums (link) or on our Volunteers Slack channel (link).

Thanks again for your support << Test First Name >>, together we can change the world üåè
Nathan Spataro and Max Kaye
Leader and Deputy Leader,
Flux
