Thank you for becoming a member of Flux!
Hey << Test First Name >>,

Thanks for becoming a member of Flux and supporting a better democracy. We're really excited to have your support! (If you don't know why you're receiving this please reply so we can fix this up).

Flux has an exciting year planned ahead, including a podcast to document our registration and campaign going in to the next election. However, none of that can happen without a healthy membership base. We'd like to take this opportunity to ask you tell two people you know about Flux, people who value democracy and the right of every Australian to participate in their democracy.

If you'd like to see our past emails to members you can find them on our Facebook page (link).

Thanks again for your support,
Nathan Spataro and Max Kaye
Leader and Deputy Leader,
Flux
