    <hr>
    <p>
      We use Slack to communicate; it's a feature rich chat app for teams with a web client as well as apps for most devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      We currently maintain two Slack teams.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first is a publicly accessible Slack team for members at fluxvolunteers.slack.com.
          However, to access this you'll need to invite yourself at <a href="https://slack.voteflux.org/">https://slack.voteflux.org/</a>.
          When we mention slack in regards to meetings, this is the Slack team we're referring to.
        </li>
        <li>The second is a closed Slack team for administrative business, and is mostly a convenience to avoid using private channels on the volunteers Slack, which quickly becomes cumbersome.</li>
      </ul>
