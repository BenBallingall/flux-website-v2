bio:
- Danielle is a tech entrepreneur and financial markets expert, who frustrated by
  the continued profiteering of the banks recently founded the world's first not for
  profit foreign exchange brokerage, Forex Nation. She doesn’t understand why a marriage
  equality plebiscite should cost the tax payer millions when the Flux platform could
  enable it for free.
- Currently Danielle is a member of NSW Minister Pru Goward’s Council for Women's
  Economic Opportunity, with a mandate to provide strategies that increase participation
  of women in non-traditional industries. She's passionate to see a return to a world
  where politicians are appointed to represent, not rule; and excited to be part of
  the first generation that will learn from people younger than them as technology
  shapes and improves our lives. Above all, Danielle is inspired by the opportunity
  to bring timely change to parliamentary process and the constitution, so they truly
  represent the lives and will of Australian people.
