bio:
  - Reece is representing the flux party because he believes that if the public are given the right tools they will be able to lead with more integrity and flexibility than any one party. He believes that flux has the ability to address some of the key issues our democracy is facing. He believes that government should be transparent, accountable and above all free from corruption. He is passionate about renewable energy and sustainability in general. It is this passion that has led him to engage in work for various charities and eventually start his own solar and electrical business.  - He joined the Flux movement in October 2015 seeing an avenue for building a better future for his son and soon to be born daughter. A strong proponent of the underlying values of what Flux stands for, Adam is eager to breath life into a new way of providing democracy for Australia.
  - Reece is excited to see how the flux system will empower people to make their voices heard on the issues we face as a country and as a planet.
